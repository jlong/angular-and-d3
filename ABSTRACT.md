Angular and D3
--------------

At first glance Angular provides a number of ways to bind your data to the DOM. What does D3 offer that makes it compelling to use Angular and D3 in a single application?

At UserVoice we are doing just that! We've leveraged D3 for it's magnificent ability to build custom charts and Angular to make it easy to build the rest of our application.

In this talk, we'll look at ways to use Angular and D3 together! We'll first build a custom graph in D3 and then look at ways of making that graph accessible in Angular. Along the way you will learn something about integrating Angular with other libraries and using the best tool for the job.
